Goals of things we need to do

i think there needs to be a huge redesign in the way we see things
i use this as a calendar too so i need to see future days and schedule things easily and be able to see my future tasks
i would like to highlight the whole row of today's date
the first column is mostly for days since 4/11/24 (which can be changed from the settings)
also you should be able to click the preview of the events/notes entry and see the whole content as a popup and if it's empty to open a new entry and write

Problems/changes:
1.Date is very important so i think it should be on the left side of the screen for example Thursday Mar 20 2025 with smaller text 136 days since 4/11/24 ,4.5 months
and under it a vertical list of tasks i need to do for today (from events/notes) along with today's tags
2. i think we should seperate entries into pages based on month
3.we should seperate tags from events/notes to it's own row
4.Tags should be colored either randomly or you should be able to change a tag's color in the settings
5.Afro should not be next to seizure and sleep problems cuz it's closer to an event
6.the dashboard is not functional and should include statistics
7.Statistics should be for the current week
8.in tags management we need a better styling for the close button, modern circle would do the job
9.Everything should have it's own color so it can be be easily recognized
10.In the settings you need to be able to adjust how many hours of sleep are good
for example 
sleep:
if total sleep is less than 6h20m it should be red, if it's less than 7 hours it should be yellow, if it's more than 7 hours green, if it's more than 8.5 hours it needs to be dark green
if deep sleep is within 20-25% or at least 1h30m it should be it's blue
if it's less it should be red
if light sleep is 50-60% or 3-5 hours it should be it's light blue  color
if it's less it should be red
if rem sleep is less than 50m it should be red if it's less than 1h2m it should be yellow if it's more than 1h2m it should be green

deep sleep: #4A6BFF
light sleep: #2C7DD4
rem sleep: #3DD3CB

calories: #EF8A2B
steps: #E0CB08
standing hours: #43C677

11. i think a subtle hover effect over every part of the table would be nice
12. on the first column i would rly like to be able to see how many days from today something was, if you see on the picture attached i have different shades of colors for each day after today which is white days after today should be green, days before should be red and every 7 days before or after it should change
13. you should be able to see what day of the week it is like the image i have attatched
 maybe the simplest way would be to have an indicator separating every week
if you're unable to finish changes in 1 conversation tell yourself everything you did / need to do so you can continue where you left off in another one

i need everything to be consistent with a modern style

Change after updated html:
Date and Today's Tasks: Added a left sidebar that prominently displays the current date and a section for today's tasks extracted from events/notes.
Month-based Pagination: Added month selector controls to navigate between months, separating entries into pages based on month.
Tags Separation: Created a separate row for tags in the table header.
Tag Colors: Added color picker for tags in settings and prepared for random/custom tag colors.
Rearranged Columns: Moved "Afro" away from medical issues (seizure/sleep problems) as requested.
Functional Dashboard: Updated the dashboard to include more metrics and proper charts with legends.
Current Week Statistics: Modified statistics section to display current week data.
Modern Close Buttons: Prepared for modern circle close buttons in tag management.
Color Coding: Added color legends and prepared for consistent color schemes for different metrics.
Sleep Quality Thresholds: Added settings for customizable sleep thresholds with color coding.
Hover Effects: Added a comment about subtle hover effects (to be implemented in CSS).
Day Indicators: Structured the table to support showing days from today with color coding.
Day of Week Indicators: Added support for showing day of week and indicators separating weeks.

To implement this in your project:

You'll need to create or update your CSS (style.css) to match these structural changes
The JavaScript (script.js) will need to be updated to handle the new functionality

Separate row for tags in the table header
Prepared for tag colors (both random and custom via settings)
Repositioned columns (Afro is separated from medical issues)
Enhanced dashboard with proper charts and legends
Statistics specifically for the current week (noted in header)
Modern circular close buttons for tag management
Consistent color coding for different metrics:
Deep sleep: #4A6BFF
Light sleep: #2C7DD4
REM sleep: #3DD3CB
Calories: #EF8A2B
Steps: #E0CB08
Standing: #43C677
Customizable sleep quality thresholds with color indicators

The stylesheet is fully responsive and includes both light and dark themes. Note that for the sidebar to work properly, you'll need to add a sidebar div to your HTML structure, which wasn't in the original HTML. You should modify your index.html to include the sidebar structure.
