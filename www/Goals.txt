Notes:
no need for mobile design
this will be used on a computer on a self hosted web app

Problems/changes:
General problems:

The list isn't being filled on it's own

2.The tags filter should show all tags and new tags dynamically
3.You shouldn't design for mobile it will never be used on mobile
4.Add new Task does nothing

Sidebar:
1.clicking in the side bar's today's task section should open the task and see it's details and tags, 
Instead of view all tags we should have a + button next to the tags allowing you to make a new tag and clicking on a tag should be able ot 


Clicking in the rendered list tasks you should be able to open the tasks section for that entry's date
