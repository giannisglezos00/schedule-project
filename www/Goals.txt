Notes:
no need for mobile design
this will be used on a computer on a self hosted web app

Problems/changes:

1.About the vertical list, i want it to be all the way to the left of the screen and i want it to contain,
 1a. A logo for the sleep tracker app
 1b.today's date
 1c.How many days since 4/11/2025 under that how many months it's been
 1d.A list of today's tasks
 1e.The display of today's tags
 1f.The add new entry button
 1g.The dashboard button
 1e.The settings button

 2.Current day statistics can take the header section and should fit
  2b.Average sleep duration of the last 7 days
  2c.Average steps taken of the last 7 days
  2d.Average calories burned of the last 7 days
  2e.Average standing hours of the last 7 days
 
 3.Under it should be a table full of the current month's entries along with controls for switching to the next month, a search section, a sort by section that shorts the displayed results by day,sleep time , tags, calories burnt, steps taken
 under that the table should display
 Section 1: Day
 3a. days since today
 3b. day of the week and date example Thursday 20 Mar 2025
 Section 2: Sleep
 3c. Sleep score
 3d. Total Sleep duration

 Section 3: Notes
 3h. Notes
 3i. tasks (can be many and they should be all displayed)
 3j, Tags
 3k. Afro (boolean) if my girlfriend stayed over , could be a heart instead of a check mark
 Section 4: Statistics about my day
 3l. Calories burnt
 3m. Steps taken
 3n. Standing hours
 





 









1.
and under it a vertical list of tasks i need to do for today (from events/notes) along with today's tags
there shouldn't be different ta
there should be today's tasks 
2.
There should be a task system when adding an entry, similar to tags
3.collumns shouldn't be the same size, date should fit inside the whole thing
4.background doesn't change in dark mode
5.Accent color doesn't apply
6.rem sleep is not supposed to be yellow, it should be #3DD3CB
7.you don't see a list of the whole month ahead of you, maybe it should autofill the whole month with empty entries
8.Today's date should be highlighted
9.Empty fields should be white
10.i think there should be a column next to day # that shows how many days each entry is away from today (dynamically updating ofc)
11.Events/notes popup should maybe be on hover and should just show the full events notes
12.The controls for the month should be next to add new entry and dashboard, settings should be moved all the way to the right of the screen
12.Everything should have rounded edges and a modern design
13.The results shouldn't have that much width
14.the dashboard is not functional and should display statistics
15.the popups should use all the horizontal space
16. hover effects are much appreciated

4.Tags should be colored either randomly or you should be able to change a tag's color in the settings

7.Statistics should be for the current week
8.in tags management we need a better styling for the close button, modern circle would do the job
9.Everything should have it's own color so it can be be easily recognized

deep sleep: #4A6BFF
light sleep: #2C7DD4
rem sleep: #3DD3CB

calories: #EF8A2B
steps: #E0CB08
standing hours: #43C677


## UI/UX Improvements
1. Left Sidebar Layout:
   - Prominently display current date with days since reference date (changeable in settings)
   - Show today's tasks and tags below date
   - Make date format: "Thursday Mar 20 2025" with smaller text "136 days since 4/11/24, 4.5 months"

2. Navigation & Organization:
   - Separate entries into month-based pages
   - Add clear date/week indicators in the table
   - Highlight today's row
   - Show days from today (future=green, past=red, with shade changes every 7 days)
   - Display weekday indicator

3. Table Improvements:
   - Create separate row for tags (color coded)
   - Reposition "Afro" column away from medical issues
   - Add subtle hover effects over table content
   - Allow clicking on events/notes preview to see full content as popup

4. Styling & Visual Elements:
   - Modern circle close buttons for tag management
   - Consistent color scheme for different metrics
     * Deep sleep: #4A6BFF
     * Light sleep: #2C7DD4
     * REM sleep: #3DD3CB
     * Calories: #EF8A2B
     * Steps: #E0CB08
     * Standing hours: #43C677

## Dashboard & Statistics
1. Functional dashboard with relevant statistics
2. Weekly stats (current week) instead of all-time stats
3. Sleep quality thresholds (configurable in settings):
   - Total sleep:
     * Red: <6h20m
     * Yellow: <7h
     * Green: >7h
     * Dark green: >8h30m
   - Deep sleep:
     * Good: 20-25% or at least 1h30m (blue)
     * Poor: <20% (red)
   - Light sleep:
     * Good: 50-60% or 3-5 hours (light blue)
     * Poor: outside range (red)
   - REM sleep:
     * Red: <50m
     * Yellow: <1h2m
     * Green: >1h2m

## Other Requirements
- Modern, consistent design throughout the app
- Responsive UI that works on different screen sizes
- Data persistence between sessions
- Dynamic tag creation and management
