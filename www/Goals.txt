Notes:
no need for mobile design
this will be used on a computer on a self hosted web app

Problems/changes:
General problems:
1.The header of the rendered items should be always visible and not scroll with the list
search entries tags and sort by date should be stacked horizontal and not vertically
2.The tags filter should show all tags and new tags dynamically
3.I think you need to make all the fonts smaller
4.You shouldn't design for mobile it will never be used on mobile

Sidebar:
1.Today's tasks section should display today's tasks from today's entry and should update dynamically

There should be a separate "add new task" button under add new entry

2.Dashboard is not working lets remove it
