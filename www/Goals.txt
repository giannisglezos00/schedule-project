Notes:
no need for mobile design
this will be used on a computer on a self hosted web app

Problems/changes:

The tags filter should show all tags and new tags dynamically 
You shouldn't design for mobile it will never be used on mobile
When you sort  by a tag it doesn't show only the results with that tag

clicking in the side bar's today's task section should open the task and see it's details and tags, 
Instead of view all tags we should have a + button next to the tags allowing you to make a new tag and clicking on a tag should be able ot 


Clicking in the rendered list tasks you should be able to open the tasks section for that entry's date
also the rendered list and it's top row are not aligned at all

the header showing what each section is should be always visible and the contents should scroll

Close button and clicking outside modals don't close the modal

Wake ups takes too much space, could be easily next to rem sleep

also in health indicators you can have all 4 checkboxes in the same row
Tag management could be like notes management

Note management needs to have the option to give a color to the tags

don't forget, modern and clean design


Ideas:
Weather api for each day
Automatic Subscription reminders
